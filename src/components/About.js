      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       I am a dedicated Computer Science student who loves creating clean, modern, and user-friendly websites. I have a strong passion for turning ideas into functional digital experiences, and I’m always excited to explore new tools and technologies that can help me grow as a developer. I enjoy challenging myself with different projects, continuously improving my skills, and staying curious about how things work behind the scenes. My goal is to build websites that not only look good but also feel intuitive, smooth, and accessible for everyone.
